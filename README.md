# FPS_Project

Project developed using the Untity Engine and Unity ML-Agents Toolkit (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) as a course completion work for graduation (https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/239535). This work aimed to develop an artificial intelligence capable of simulating the performance of a human player in First-Person Shooter games, specifically for the Team Deathmatch mode, through the Machine Learning method called Reinforcement Learning. Some specific objectives were:
  * Create an artificial intelligence capable of learning from its mistakes and successes;
  * Create an artificial intelligence that adapts to situations similar to the one previously trained, according to the acquired experience;
  * Make the environment created available to serve as a prototype for projects by independent developers.

The AI isn't perfect, it could be more trained to improve its performance, but is a demonstration of the Reinforcement Learning capacity.
